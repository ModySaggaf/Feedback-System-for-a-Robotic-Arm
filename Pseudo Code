Choose motors type for the robotic arm
Design the electrical circuit for the control system that consists of:
    Arduino microcontroller
    Servo motor to represent the robot arm
    Potentiometer (variablre resistor) to change the other arm's motor angle of rotation 
Code the Arduino microcontroller to operate as desired
    The Arduino reads the potentiometer's value via the analog pin
    It scales that value to match the servo motor angles values
    It sets the servo motor to rotate with that scaled angle
Rotate one motor for the other motor to rotate simultaneously
    Use the potentiometer to represent the other arm's servo motor and change its angle
